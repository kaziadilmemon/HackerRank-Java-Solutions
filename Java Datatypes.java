/* Task:
Input Format

The first line contains an integer,T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case,T, is comprised of a single line with an integer, , which can be arbitrarily large or small.

Output Format

For each input variable n and appropriate primitive dataType , you must determine if the given primitives are capable of storing it. If yes, then print:

n can be fitted in:
* dataType
If there is more than one appropriate data type, print each one on its own line and order them by size (i.e.: byte < short < int < long ).

If the number cannot be stored in one of the four aforementioned primitives, print the line:
