/* 
Question: 
You are given a class Solution with a main method. Complete the given code so that it outputs the area of a parallelogram with breadth B and height H .
You should read the variables from the standard input.

If  B<=0 or H<=0 , the output should be "java.lang.Exception: Breadth and height must be positive" without  quotes.

Input Format

There are two lines of input. The first line contains B : the breadth of the parallelogram. The next line contains H: the height of the parallelogram.

Constraints 
-100<=B<=100 , -100<=H<=100
Output Format

If both values are greater than zero, then the main method must output the area of the parallelogram. 
Otherwise, print "java.lang.Exception: Breadth and height must be positive" without quotes.*/
